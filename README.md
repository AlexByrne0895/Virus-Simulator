# Virus-Simulator
I was tasked to create a virus simulator using p5

# How To Run This Simulator
In order to run this simulator, the folder will need to be placed inside the HTDOCS folder.

Once the folder has been placed in the HTDOCS folder, the user will need to run the XAMPP Control Panel, and start running MySQL.

MySQL is required as this simulator runs using LocalHost. 

# Begin The Simulator
After MySQL has been started, the users next step is to search on the address bar "LocalHost/" followed by the name of the folder located in the HTDOCS folder.
